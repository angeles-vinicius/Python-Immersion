# Python-Immersion

Different works in Python

Project Description:
This is a simple Python exercise with a spreadsheet containing financial data for various Brazilian companies, including 
- stock prices,
- daily and historical performance metrics,
- company information like sector and age, and
- additional data points like theoretical quantity and a "Redutor" value.
This could be used by any new financial Python student.

Technologies Used:
The programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools employed in my project:
All Python code and...
pandas as pd
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
matplotlib.dates as mdates
mplfinance as mpf
yfinance as yf
plotly.graph_objects as go
plotly.subplots import make_subplots

Installation and Setup:
Google Colab
You'll need a Google account to access and use Google Colab. If you don't have one, you can create it for free.
Once you've set up your environment and loaded any necessary data, you can start running your code in the notebook cells.
Google Colab typically comes pre-installed with many common Python libraries. However, if your project requires specific dependencies that are not available by default, you can install them using the 
_!pip install _
command in a code cell.

Additional Notes:
Remember to save your notebook regularly to avoid losing your work.
You can share your Colab notebooks with others for collaboration or to showcase your project.
Colab provides a free tier with limited resources, but you can upgrade to Colab Pro for more powerful hardware and longer runtime sessions.
By following these steps and considering the prerequisites and dependencies, you can effectively set up and configure your project in Google Colab.
